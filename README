Jumper plugin for BigBrotherBot (www.bigbrotherbot.net)
=============================================================

Description
-----------
This plugin is able to track jump map times in order to add some kind of competition in Urban Terror public Jump Servers.
To avoid fake records the plugin will auto-record a server-side demo on every run (after a !start command being launched).
The plugin will also "handle" empty jump servers, cycling the current map when the server gets empty for more than 10 minutes.
In order to make this plugin works properly you need at least the ioq3-for-UrbanTerror-4 server engine release by Frozen Sands on January 2012
which carries the server-side demo recording patch provided by the 1up clan.


Installation
------------

 * copy jumper.py into b3/extplugins
 * copy jumper.xml into b3/extplugins/conf
 * create necessary table by importing jumper.sql into your MySQL database
 * edit your b3.xml config file adding :
 
<plugin name="jumper" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/jumper.xml"/>
